name: agent-delegation
description: Delegate a task to another coding agent from any supported tool. Native targets include Codex, Cursor Agent, OpenCode, Claude Code, and Goose. Adapter-configured targets can include Gemini CLI, Aider, Amp, Cline, Droid, and other shell-callable agents.

# Agent Delegation

Use the shared shell entrypoint:

```bash
ai-delegate ...
```

This works from Codex, Cursor Agent, OpenCode, Claude Code, Goose, and adapter-configured tools because it launches the target agent as a headless worker process.

## When To Use

- The user explicitly says to ask another agent
- The user wants Codex to fix something from Cursor or OpenCode
- The user wants Cursor Agent to take a harder implementation task
- The user wants OpenCode to take a straightforward implementation task
- The user wants automatic routing by difficulty

## Routing Rules

- `codex`:
  - Use for final review, fallback, and difficult reasoning-heavy work
  - Good when the user explicitly says "ask codex"
- `cursor`:
  - Use for harder implementation/debug/refactor tasks
  - Good when the user explicitly says "ask cursor" or "cursor agent should fix this"
- `opencode`:
  - Use for easier implementation tasks
  - Good when the user explicitly says "ask opencode"
- `claude`:
  - Use for explicit Claude Code delegation
  - Good when the user explicitly says "ask claude" or "use claude code"
- `goose`:
  - Use for explicit Goose delegation
  - Good when the user explicitly says "ask goose"
- `gemini`, `aider`, `amp`, `cline`, `droid`:
  - Supported through the adapter registry in `~/.config/ai-bridge/adapters.json`
  - Use when the user explicitly names one of these tools and the machine has a matching adapter command configured
- `auto`:
  - Uses difficulty-based routing
  - Easy: OpenCode first, then Cursor
  - Hard: Cursor first, then OpenCode

## Commands

Explicit target:

```bash
ai-delegate --target codex --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Fix the failing parser tests"
ai-delegate --target cursor --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent cursor-agent -- "Refactor the auth pipeline safely"
ai-delegate --target opencode --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent opencode -- "Add a compact settings toggle"
ai-delegate --target claude --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Debug the broken migration"
ai-delegate --target goose --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Investigate the flaky test"
ai-delegate --target gemini --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Investigate the flaky test"
```

Automatic routing:

```bash
ai-delegate --target auto --difficulty easy --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Implement a simple preferences screen"
ai-delegate --target auto --difficulty hard --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Debug the race condition in the sync engine"
```

Structured output:

```bash
ai-delegate --target codex --json --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent cursor-agent -- "Fix the broken CI workflow"
```

Background mode with completion notification:

```bash
ai-delegate --target auto --difficulty hard --background --notify-on-complete --cwd "$PWD" --from-agent codex -- "Run the refactor and tell me when it's done"
```

## How To Use It Correctly

1. If the user names a specific agent, use `--target` with that exact agent.
2. If the user asks for delegation by difficulty, use `--target auto` and set `--difficulty easy|hard`.
3. Always pass the current working directory with `--cwd "$PWD"` so the delegated worker runs in the right repo.
4. Always pass your current tool name with `--from-agent ...`:
   - Codex: `codex`
   - Cursor Agent: `cursor-agent`
   - OpenCode: `opencode`
   - Claude Code: `claude-code`
5. Read the returned result critically. Delegation is not automatic validation.
6. If the delegated worker fails or returns an incomplete result, continue locally or escalate to Codex if that matches the user's request.
7. For long-running work, prefer `--background --notify-on-complete` so the caller can keep working and receive a completion notice on the next prompt.

## Notes

- `ai-delegate` launches the real agent CLI. This is Hermes-style delegation via shell command, not an internal model handoff.
- `ai-delegate --target codex` uses `codex exec`.
- `ai-delegate --target cursor` uses the `agent-hard` wrapper.
- `ai-delegate --target opencode` uses the `opencode-easy` wrapper.
- `ai-delegate --target claude` uses the `claude-code-worker` wrapper.
- `ai-delegate --target goose` uses `goose run --text`.
- Other named tools are supported through the adapter registry in `~/.config/ai-bridge/adapters.json`.
- `ai-delegate --target auto` only routes between OpenCode and Cursor. Codex remains the intended reviewer/fallback unless the caller explicitly targets Codex.
- `--background --notify-on-complete` adds Hermes-style completion tracking. Finished jobs are surfaced back into the caller's next prompt context.
